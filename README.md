## EXPENCE TRACKER React

### Description
A school project designed to gain hands-on experience in utilizing 
React and grasp a deeper understanding of React fundamental concepts, as well as using Git to manage the project. 
I created an “Expense Tracker App” using React. The application allows 
users to enter data about their expenses in separate categories, to delete expenses, and display the 
registered expenses.
